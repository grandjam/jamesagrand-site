As a mentor, I believe my role is to help students find and stick with their passions, recognize and hone their unique strengths, and attempt to model professional and personal behavior that fosters a positive outlook on career success. Given these values, my mentoring philosophy can be summarized as the following:\n I believe my role as a faculty mentor is to\u0026hellip;\n Challenge mentees to become independent and critical thinkers Identify and connect mentees to beneficial professional opportunities Build the confidence, network, and social capital of mentees Expose mentees to new and alternative perspectives Support and facilitate the development of mentees' professional identities   I find that I am able to pursue these ideals best by fostering mentoring relationships with both undergraduate and graduate students more as a “facilitator” rather than “supervisor.” The opportunity to work with, learn from, and contribute to the development of student collaborators is among the very best parts of my job. This page provides a brief overview of my approach to mentoring both graduate and undergraduate students. If you are interested in working with me, please check out the pages for prospective PhD students and undergraduate research assistants to see if I\u0026rsquo;m currently recruiting and for more information on what it is like to work with me and my lab.\n\rGRADUATE STUDENT MENTORING I believe strongly in the importance of graduate students developing a professional identity that is uniquely their own. To this end, I approach graduate education as a true apprenticeship and consider my advisees as essentially junior colleagues for whom it is my job to support and help succeed. This means that I do not just tell my advisees what they should do or how they should do it nor do I simply give them ready-made projects to complete. I prefer to allow graduate students to have their own input and work together with me jointly to develop research. Additionally, I frequently support my advisees’ interests in pursuing topics of study and educational opportunities that may not be directly relevant/applicable to my ongoing work or areas of research. Although this can result in a more diffuse focus in our work and places a heavy onus and sense of personal accountability on my advisees, I believe these experiences are critical to graduate education as they help to simultaneously broaden one\u0026rsquo;s skillsets while establishing a unique specialization.\nTo ensure that my advisees are still making progress towards important milestones, I typically hold weekly one-on-one meetings to discuss both collaborative and independent project work, as well as converse about new ideas, methodologies, and topics of mutual interest. I also conduct a more formalized feedback session with each of my graduate students at least once a year (outside of and in addition to any feedback they receive from standard department-/program-level reviews) in which we discuss accomplishments, reflect on areas/competencies where they feel they are doing well and those where they would like to improve, and talk about career plans and goals for achieving them.\n\rUNDERGRADUATE STUDENT MENTORING Outside of my role as an instructor, I tend to have three primary areas of opportunity for mentoring undergraduate students:\n The first is with undergraduate students who volunteer to work in my lab as research assistants (RAs). I strive to maintain an active research lab with approximately 4-6 undergraduate RAs per semester. Although this is a smaller number of students than in many other labs, I find that this allows me to develop more meaningful and developmental relationships and fits my mentoring and working style better. I hold bi-weekly lab meetings for the lab in which we converse about ongoing studies, discuss papers of interest selected and led by undergraduate students, and talk about procedures, advice, and concerns related to graduate school and careers in psychology. We also use time in our lab to work on student-led projects for the department\u0026rsquo;s undergraduate research fair. The second is with undergraduate students who volunteer to work as teaching assistants (TAs) for the undergraduate courses I lead. I usually aim to have 1-2 undergraduate TAs in my courses if possible. In semesters where I\u0026rsquo;m fortunate to have student TAs, we meet on a biweekly basis to discuss class operations, basic principles of pedagogy, assessment design, and student engagement. TAs are also given the opportunity to develop and deliver a \u0026ldquo;mini-lecture\u0026rdquo; on a topic of their choosing to the class. In addition to helping come up with and practicing the material, I provide developmental feedback after the mini-lecture to provide students with suggestions and ideas for continuing to improve the communication and teaching skills. The third is through impromptu meetings with students who contact me and just want to talk. Outside of my normal office hours, I do my best to make myself available to meet with both current and former students to talk about the field of IO psychology, offer advice about internships, graduate school, or careers, and to review application materials for jobs, schools, and fellowships.

To this end, I attempt to consider this question from the perspective of a prospective student\u0026rsquo;s supplementary and complementary fit:\n Supplementary fit refers to when two parties possess similar capabilities and/or values. Like adding more of your favorite toppings to an ice cream sundae, supplementary fit is improved by the extent to which each party adds to the presence of an already desirable quality. Complementary fit refers to when the weaknesses/needs of one party are offset by the strengths/resources of the other. Like putting together the pieces of a puzzle, complementary fit is improved by the extent to which each party brings something that the other wants, needs, or benefits from.  Based on these distinctions, I\u0026rsquo;ve listed some aspects of prospective PhD students that are likely to have high complementary and supplementary fit with me, my work, and my approach to training PhD students.\n Supplementary attributes  Inter- and/or trans-disciplinary interests. As noted in my research philosophy, I place high value on integrating ideas across different areas of psychology and other scientific disciplines. If you are primarily only interested in developing knowledge within a single field (i.e., only IO psychology, only social psychology), you are less likely to fit well with my work or approach to PhD training. Commitment to research. I am motivated and do all that I can to support whatever career path my students ultimately find rewarding. However, by signing up for a PhD program in psychology, you are committing to learning how to conduct research and become a social scientist. If you are primarily interested in going directly into a practice/consulting career with little to no interest in engaging in the research process (e.g., designing/conducting studies, writing publications, presenting at conferences), you are less likely to fit well with my work or approach to PhD training.    Complementary attributes  Independence and self-motivation. As described in my mentoring statement, I believe that a critical component of graduate training is the development of one\u0026rsquo;s personal and professional identity. I further believe this is difficult to attain if the advisee-advisor relationship is one in which I (as the advisor) simply tell you (as the advisee) exactly what to do or what to work on. Instead, I think this development process is facilitated by approaching the mentoring relationship as one in which I and my advisees are acitve and participative decision-makers in the work we do. This does not mean that I expect my advisees to be wholly \u0026ldquo;on their own\u0026rdquo; from day one or that there will not be times in which I have a specific project in mind for an advisee. However, it does mean that if you are looking for an advisor to hand you ideas, projects, topics, papers, etc. that are ready-to-go and for which your role is mostly to just follow orders to complete the work, you are less likely to fit well with my working and mentoring style. Research interests/topics. I am generally less concerned with whether I share the exact same specific topics of research interest (e.g., team cognition, team processes, training) with my graduate students. Indeed, the opportunity to learn, grow, and be pushed by the unique interests of my students is something I find very rewarding and motivating. However, I have a strong inclination towards approaching research questions/topics from the perspective of complex systems, process mechanisms, and observing behaviors over time. Furthemore, having at least some alignment with my substantive interests can be helpful as there are certainly many topics that I simply won\u0026rsquo;t possess the requisite expertise in to be as effective of a mentor. Nevertheless, so as long as you are open/willing to integrate your ideas and collaborate with me on your specific research interests, you are likely to fit well with my work and approach to PhD training.    \r What do you think makes a great PhD student? Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses that make them unique, and there is certainly no one \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; way to succeed as a PhD student. In my experience, the best doctoral students I have seen and/or had the opportunity to work with all had some combination of the following capacities. Note this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I think a person must have all of these things to be successful as a PhD candidate; but all successful PhD candidates I\u0026rsquo;ve known had many of these qualities to different degrees.\n Intellectual curiosity. I think a deep passion for learning is a hallmark of great scientists and thinkers. The motivation to always question what we think we know, how or why we think we know things, and to want to pursue new knowledge that helps better understand the world around us is helpful for keeping you going in a PhD program (and beyond).  Ways to develop:  Read widely (not just within your own area of interests) Listen to others talk/present about their work and ask questions Seek opportunities to learn from and with people doing things you know little to nothing about      Conscientiousness. Being organized, disciplined, and a dependable collaborator and student are helpful for managing the workload and obligations of a PhD program. As a PhD student, you will have a fair bit more independence and choice with respect to when and how you accomplish your work than you did as an undergraduate student. Being able to effectively and efficiently manage your personal and collegial responsibilities is instrumental to meeting important milestones.  Ways to develop:  Use a weekly calendar/scheduler to organize your time Create plans for accomplishing your work with specific tasks, milestones, and deadlines Arrive early (rather than on time) for events      Writing and communication skills. Getting a PhD in the social sciences means you are signing up to become an expert in an area that almost everyone thinks they already know something about. The ability to clearly and concisely convey your knowledge, research, and expertise to your peers, advisors, colleagues, and the public through both written and spoken language is paramount to success both while in and after finishing your PhD program.  Ways to develop:  Create and use outlines before starting to write or put together a speech Share your writing and practice presentations with others before you submit the final product Seek feedback and help from writing centers and/or peers whose communication skills you admire      Critical thinking and argumentation skills. All of science involves formulating ideas about how the world works, gathering and interpreting observations, and evaluating evidentiary claims. The capacity to piece together a coherent and sensible argument, defend/support an idea or conclusion, and incorporate new or different knowledge into your worldview are all instrumental to growing as a PhD scientist and practitioner.  Ways to develop:  After writing a complete draft of a paper, write a reverse outline where you summarize the points made in each paragraph Practice your listening and ask questions \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;d be suprised at how much you can learn about how/why people think about something by simply listening Practice your meta-cognitive and self-reflection skills by asking why you feel, believe, or react in a particular way      Collaboration skills and prosocial orientation. The development and application of scientific knowledge to better understand and improve the world is a \u0026ldquo;team sport.\u0026rdquo; The days of the lone wolf, go-it-your-own scientist are over. Being able to work in and contribute to collaborative efforts through forming supportive and enriching relationships with peers, colleagues, and other stakeholders is a must.  Ways to develop:  Actively participate in group assignments/projects Consider what you are giving and receiving in your working relationships and strive to keep them balanced Practice giving and receiving construtive feedback      \r How do you evaluate PhD applications? Although the term is often over-used and under-defined in higher education admissions, I do my best to adopt a holistic review of prospective PhD candidates. For my purposes, this means three things:\n There is no single piece of information (e.g., GPA, standardized test scores, research experience) that I use to determine whether someone is versus is not qualified as an applicant There are no specific thresholds of achievement that I rely upon when evaluating applicant qualifications To the extent possible and based on the available information, I do my best to take the context and/or circumstances of an applicants' experiences into account when interpreting their achievements  A low GPA, poor GRE scores, or minimal research experience is thus not guaranteed to tank your application, especially if there were extenuating life circumstances that may have impacted your academic experiences. In such cases however, it is critical to use alternative means to convey your potential for success as a PhD student in your application. For example, you could ask your letter writers to specifically comment on your circumstances and/or provide this information in your personal statement to help me better contextualize your application.\nIn the previous section (\u0026ldquo;What do you think makes a great PhD student?\u0026quot;), I listed several competencies that I feel tend to be indicative of success as a PhD student and future scientist-practitioner. When reviewing prospective students, I generally attempt to formulate impressions of each of these facets based on the information provided in your application. There is no single metric that conveys each of these attributes perfectly, but in the interest of transparency, I\u0026rsquo;ve provided examples of some of the indicators I attend to when forming these interpretations below. This list is non-exhaustive and is not intended to reflect my final decision-making process.\n Intellectual curiosity  Potential indicators:  Conducting independent research (e.g., honor\u0026rsquo;s thesis, first-authored posters, talks, or papers) Participating in one or more research labs Attending and/or presenting at conferences or research fairs Letters of recommendation      Conscientiousness  Potential indicators:  Experience as a research lab manager Direct experience preparing study materials, collecting data, or conducting analyses Writing and/or co-authoring papers Undergraduate GPA Leadership positions in work, school, or community organizations      Writing and communication skills  Potential indicators:  Writing and/or co-authoring papers Conducting independent research (e.g., honor\u0026rsquo;s thesis, first-authored posters, talks, or papers) Presenting at conferences or research fairs Quality of writing in the personal statement Quality of writing samples      Critical thinking and argumentation skills  Potential indicators:  Conducting independent research (e.g., honor\u0026rsquo;s thesis, first-authored posters, talks, or papers) Writing and/or co-authoring papers Participating in one or more research labs Quality of writing samples Letters of recommendation      Collaboration skills and prosocial orientation  Potential indicators  Leadership positions in work, school, or community organizations Accomplishments and feedback on group projects Participating in one or more research labs Co-authoring papers Letters of recommendation      \r Should I let you know of my interest in working with you? Can I schedule a call with you for more information? You are welcome to email me to introduce yourself prior to sending your application, but it is not required\u0026ndash;and frankly does not affect your chances of being selected.\nAdditionally, there is simply not enough time in the day for me to take meetings or phone/video calls with all applicants who wish to chat. I thus have a policy of not scheduling private conversations with any prospecitve student during the application process unless there are particularly unusual circumstances (e.g., military applicants, applicants with atypical funding situations). After I have completed my initial review of all submitted applications, I schedule phone/video calls with a small number of applicants to provide an opportunity for us to further discuss mutual interests and learn more about relevant experiences.\nYou may email me or any of my current graduate students if you have specific questions that are not addressed here. However, and prior to doing so, I strongly encourage you to review all the information found on my website as you will likely find answers to many common questions about the work I do and what it would be like to work with me.\n\r ","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"4761aae6ca8c8ffd7f03ce48eb8ea5f6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/get-involved/prospective-phd-students/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/get-involved/prospective-phd-students/","section":"get-involved","summary":"I intend to recruit a new PhD student during the current application cycle.

Individuals pursue learning at academic and professional institutions for a variety of reasons, and each person brings with them a unique set of capabilities, experiences, and interests that influence their goals and motivations as well as likes and dislikes. Nevertheless, I believe that there are a small number of themes universally critical to the success of undergraduate and graduate education\u0026ndash;and these are the targets I aim for in my role as a teacher. These foci are represented in my teaching philosophy, summarized as follows:\n I believe my role as an instructor is to encourage and help students\u0026hellip;\n Think critically, draw reasoned inferences, and raise questions about topics, events, or phenomena of personal and societal interest Apply knowledge and skills to resolve questions or issues of personal significance Identify and understand how to effectively use resources, opportunities, and experiences that enable continual learning and development beyond the classroom   A brief description of the courses I have taught at the undergraduate and graduate level are listed below. Sample syllabi for each course are also provided for anyone interested in designing a course on a similar topic. I update my course content and structure on a semi-regular basis, so the provided syllabi are not guaranteed to match those of any courses I may be currently teaching or may teach in the future. If you are an instructor interested in any of my teaching materials, please feel free to contact me with specific requests and I will be happy to discuss.\n\rUNDERGRADUATE TEACHING My approach to undergraduate instruction is organized around three main principles:\n Clear and consistent organization of content, ideas, and expectations Instructional delivery that promotes engagement and active learning Promoting the application of learned material to topics beyond the classroom  I attempt to achieve these goals through a variety of means, including the use of specific and direct learning objectives, frequent participative exercises and discussions, the integration of personal, student, and current event examples to supplement course content, and the integration of hands-on application assignments as part of the formal course assessment.\nIntroduction to Industrial/Organizational Psychology The field of Industrial/Organizational (I/O) psychology is a fascinating discipline that blends rigorous research methodologies and practical applications towards understanding the following:\n How do the emotions, behaviors, thoughts, and motivations of individuals at work contribute to their overall performance and quality of life as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of the organizations for which they work?\n Introduction to Industrial/Organizational Psychology is designed to introduce students to topics, concepts, and principles relevant to understanding and improving people at work from the time they enter the labor force until retirement as well as the organizations in which they work. The course content focuses on understanding the psychological bases of work behaviors, cognitions, and emotions, and practices that can be implemented to create a good fit between employees and work demands. Example topics discussed in the class include the structure/characteristics of jobs, techniques for assessing and supporting employee performance, selecting and training a workforce, employee motivation and attitudes, work teams, and organizational leadereship.\n\rSyllabus\r\r\r Teams and Small Group Behavior The study of group dynamics is a unique topic in that its primary questions of interest simultaneously acknowledge two key psychological experiences of individuals:\n How do the emotions, behaviors, thoughts, and motivations of individuals influence group members AND how do groups and their situational contexts influence the experiences of individuals?\n Teams and Small Group Behavior is designed to introduce students to important concepts, findings, phenomena, and principles relevant to understanding group dynamics\u0026ndash;the processes and actions which occur within and between groups and their members over time. The course content explores characteristics and outcomes associated with how individuals interact in group settings; how groups/teams influence how individuals behave, think, and feel; and the ways in which group/team functioning can be supported to promote desired outcomes. Example topics discussed in the class include the formation and development of groups, perceptual, social, and experiential mechanisms which influence how individuals behave in groups, and features and consequences associated with poorly versus well-functioning groups.\n\rSyllabus\r\r\r Research Methods in Psychology Conducting and interpreting research aimed at better understanding human behavior, emotion, and cognition poses several unique challenge. To this end, all subfields of psychology are faced with the following question:\n How can we learn about people and events in a way that reliably and accurately improves our understanding of human beings and the manner in which they function?\n Research Methods for Psychology is designed to introduce students to fundamental concepts and techniques relevant to research in the social and psychological sciences. The course content is targeted towards developing skills and competence in understanding how to critically think, make predictions, advance evidence, and interpret conclusions about observations relevant to human behavior, emotions, and cognition. Specific topics discussed in the class include the basics of scientific inquiry and causality, measurement, and research design.\n\rSyllabus\r\r \rGRADUATE TEACHING I prefer to approach graduate student teaching from the perspective of an “informal apprenticeship” model. Thus, in addition to the priniples listed above, I also attempt to adhere to the following principles for graduate instruction:\n Facilitate the learning process by acting as an active resource/guide rather than the \u0026ldquo;final decision-maker\u0026rdquo; about the learning experience Foster the development of student expertise and professional identity  The graduate courses I offer frequently draw students from multiple and diverse disciplines, including organizational psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, management/organizational behavior, marketing, higher education, information science, and engineering. With such wide variance in training and disciplinary norms, I strive to leverage those unique perspectives in ways that enrich the personal and collective learning of all students by inviting participants to make their unique backgrounds a central point of our class meetings and activities.\nIntroduction to Industrial/Organizational Psychology Industrial and organizational (IO) psychology is the scientific study and application of psychological principles, theory, and research in the workplace. This course is designed to be an advanced survey of the field and will cover a wide range of topics from both the “I” (e.g., selection, training, performance) and “O” (e.g., motivation, leadership, teams) sides of the discipline. Through reading, discussion, and critical evaluation, students will participate in developing an integrative view of IO psychology as a science, profession, and scholarly endeavor.\n\rSyllabus\r\r\r Multilevel Theory and Dynamics This PhD level seminar explores and critically examines principles, methodologies, and analytical approaches for research involving complex systems and dynamics that span multiple levels of analysis (e.g., time, individual, dyad, team, organization, society). The primary orientation of this course is theoretical and conceptual. That is, the goal is to equip students with foundational knowledge and interpretive skills for thinking about and capturing how human behavior, cognition, and affect changes and unfolds across time, and how those processes emerge and exhibit influence across levels in ways that shape interactions and psychological outcomes. In doing so, the course explores a variety of methodological techniques, analytic approaches, and applications.\n\rSyllabus\r\r\r Judgment and Decision-Making Judgment, decision-making, and choice are processes which permeate virtually every aspect of human life\u0026ndash;and the theoretical perspectives and practical applications of these concepts are equally large and diverse. This course is designed to be a survey of key theories and considerations related to the formal study of human decision and choice. Through reading, discussion, and evaluation, students will participate in developing an integrative view of both historical and contemporary approaches to understanding human decision-making, the methods used to study these phenomena, and applications of research in this area.\n\rSyllabus\r\r\r Research Methods in Social and Organizational Psychology Psychological science is built upon systematic efforts to identify, understand, and explain phenomena involving human affect, behavior, and cognition in terms of cause-effect relations. Social and organizational psychology tends to emphasize how interactions among intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental processes/factors contribute to these relations. Advancing scientific understanding of these phenomena necessitates conducting rigorous research that contributes to accurate knowledge. Arguably the most significant choices relevant to achieving this goal concern research design (the methods used to gather and examine observations) and measurement (the processes/techniques by which observations are assessed, quantified, and documented). The purpose of this course is to help students develop an advanced understanding of theory, practice, and techniques relevant to research design and measurement.\n\rSyllabus\r\r\r ","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"TEACHING PHILOSOPHY My teaching philosophy is guided by my beliefs about the role and purpose of a college education.

It\u0026rsquo;s also just a lot of fun!\nThis page provides information on basic expectations and requirements for participating in the lab as an undergraduate RA as well as answers to some frequently asked questions. If you are considering joining the lab, please review the information below prior to submitting an application. You may also contact me or any of my current graduate students directly if you have specific questions not addressed here.\n\rWhat do undergraduate RAs in the lab do? The undergraduate RAs who collaborate with me and my graduate students participate in many different activities. The specific things you may be asked to help with will vary depending on current projects and needs, but the list below provides examples of some common tasks:\n Running data collection sessions (i.e., setting up the lab, instructing and assisting participants on study tasks, debriefing participants, etc.) Scheduling and distributing credits/payments to study participants Working with data (i.e., coding, cleaning, analyzing, reviewing/interpreting) Providing input/feedback on study ideas and designs Assisting with the development and piloting of lab tasks, measures, etc. Contributing to the creation (and, depending on contribution, potentially serving as an author for) posters, presentations and papers Reading, presenting, and discussing research articles with lab members  \r What can I expect from you and what do you expect of me? In my view, one of the key purposes of participating in a lab is to gain experience, learn new things that may not be part of your coursework, and get to know me, my graduate students, and some of your fellow classmates in a professional non-classroom environment. To that end, here are my commitments to those collaborating with me in the lab and the commitments I expect in return.\nWhat you can expect of me:  I will be available to provide advice, suggestions, and guidance to you on topics related to your coursework, graduate school, and career options I will do my best to provide you with opportunities and experiences that are important, relevant, and useful to your goals I will always treat you and all members of the lab with respect and courtesy I will ask for and take your input into consideration on questions and decisions relevant to the lab I wlil do my best to support and accommodate any unique life or school circumstances that may affect your participation in the lab  What I expect of you:  I expect you to be an active participant in and willing volunteer for lab-relevant tasks I expect you to fulfill any and all formal obligations as part of your membership in the lab (i.e., attending meetings, fulfilling time commitments and course credit requirements, completing any required trainings) I expect you to communicate with me and my graduate students regularly (especially when asked for your input/assistance on lab-relevant tasks or when unusual circumstances arise) I expect you to treat me and all members of the lab with respect and courtesy I expect you to interact with all research participants in our lab in a professional and respectful manner  A failure to meet any of these expectations in a reasonable manner may result in dismissal from the lab.\n\r Can I participate in the lab for course credit? The University of Maryland psychology department offers the option for undergraduate RAs to earn course credit by enrolling in PSYC479. However, to participate in my lab for credit, you must meet the following eligibility requirements.\nAt least one of the following must be true\u0026hellip; Have participated as an undergraduate RA in my lab for at least one semester\r\r\rHave participated as an undergraduate RA in another faculty member's lab for at least one semester (requires informal recommendation from the faculty member)\r\r\rHave participated as an undergraduate TA for one of my classes for at least one semester\r\r\r\u0026hellip; and all of the following must be true: Are a junior or senior with at least a 3.0 GPA and at least 9 credits in PSYC (these are deparment requirements)\r\r\rCan commit a minimum of 3 hours per week (i.e., 45 hours total per semester) to the lab\r\r\rCan attend all lab meetings (i.e., no regularly scheduled conflicts with lab meeting time)\r\r\rWill complete either a short paper or presentation by the end of the semester on a topic agreed upon with Prof. Grand\r\r\rPlease note that if you do not meet the above criteria, you are still eligible to apply for the lab as a volunteer undergraduate RA for no course credit. \r How much time am I expected to commit to the lab? The minimum time commitment I ask of all undergraduate RAs is 3 hours per week (i.e., 45 hours total per semester). Note that your time commitment will be greater if you are enrolled in PSYC479 for more than 1 course credit.\nPlease note that I expect all RAs to attend our regularly scheduled lab meetings. Only under very special circumstances will I allow an undergraduate RA to be part of the lab but not attend lab meetings. Attending and participating in these meetings is a critical part of the lab experience. It is one of the best ways for you to stay involved and get to know me and the other members of the lab\u0026ndash;plus it\u0026rsquo;s more fun when everyone is present! Lab meetings are typically held bi-weekly, run for one hour, and count towards your expected time commitment. The specific dates and times for lab meetings will be set prior to the beginning of each semester; I will do my best to accomodate people\u0026rsquo;s course schedules, but it is not always possible for me to do so.\n\r What projects will I work on? The specific projects that we do in the lab and to which you might contribute varies from semester to semester. It is especially common for undergraduate RAs to work closely with my current graduate students on their thesis and dissertation research. To get a sense for some of the types of projects I do though, please check out the Projects page.\n\n Can I do an independent research project or honor\u0026rsquo;s thesis with you? Yes! Please contact me directly to discuss availability and options.\nAdditionally, I strongly encourage and assist all RAs working in the lab with preparing a poster submission for our department\u0026rsquo;s annual research fair. This may involve presenting data we\u0026rsquo;re currently collecting in the lab, data that has been previously collected by me or others in the lab, or new data that any RAs are interested in collecting for their research idea.\n\r ","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"9bccd1e974b32a6c1f3fde086dabd336","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/get-involved/undergraduate-ra/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/get-involved/undergraduate-ra/","section":"get-involved","summary":"I am currently accepting applications for volunteer undergraduate research assistants.

In response, a world-wide restructuring of work around teams has occurred. As teams have become the dominant unit of work, team-based systems composed of teams of teams have also begun to emerge as a new organizational form (e.g., multiteam systems, MTSs). Managing and enhancing those facets that contribute to the effectiveness of teams and team-based systems depends on understanding the dynamic forces which influence how individuals within and between teams combine their efforts to successfully fulfill task demands in uncertain environments.\nIn this stream of research, my colleageus and I have sought to develop a highly flexible and generalizable architecture for building, integrating, and testing theory related to team and team-based system effectiveness. Our work is deeply rooted in the principles of complex adaptive systems and adopts the perspective that collective functioning is an emergent property of the behaviors, choices, and perceptions of individual members of the collective; their relational interactions and influences; and the social and task environments in which those individuals operate. To this end, our research group has advanced a scalable and integrative agent-based model that allows us to represent various attributes and decision processes of individual team members, task demands, and the formation of interpersonal perceptions and influence that can affect interaction.\nWe have conducted numerous simulation studies with the model to evaluate its correspondence with existing research/theory as well as probe and reveal insights into several compelling questions. For example:\n  How does the composition of a team (i.e., the constellation of skills, demographics, dispostional attributes, etc.) affect the emergence of cohesion, influence, and performance under different task environments? Can a team be more (or less) than the sum of its parts? How and in what ways can a single individual influence an entire collective? When can maximizing the performance of a single team come at the expense of overall system performance in a MTS?

Although there are now numerous different conceptulations of team cognitio, the concept has most commonly been examined from the perspective of shared mental models (extent to which individual members of a team hold similar cogntiive representations of the team and its task) and transactive memory systems (extent to which collectively relevant knowledge about the team and its task is distributed across yet accessible to individual members). There is sufficient meta-analytic evidence to suggest that both conceptualizations of team cognition are important to the performance and decision quality of teams. However, a coherent understanding of how groups develop, integrate, and adapt these forms of shared cognition remains incomplete. That is, little attention has been directed towards the dynamic processes through which knowledge is acquired, compiles, and manifests within teams. The manner by which team knowledge is created and sustained remains a “black box.”\nA lack of theoretical and empirical attention towards unpacking this black box and revealing the processes responsible for team knowledge emergence is problematic for at least two reasons. First, the development and maintenance of knowledge at the team level inherently involves intra- and inter-member processes unfolding over time. However, what these processes are and how they interact to facilitate team cognition are not well explicated. Second, ignoring the process of team knowledge emergence limits inferences about why teams may be more or less successful at achieving desired levels of team cognition. Focusing on static, variable-to-variables relationships between predictors and team knowledge outcomes (i.e., higher team ability -\u0026gt; better team cognition) can suggest conditions that correlate with the development of collective knowledge. However, such research does not provide insight into how or why these conditions lead to improved knowledge outcomes. Systematically exploring these questions requires concerted efforts to develop more precise theory and conduct more focused empirical research that capture the events, actions, and cognitive processes that contribute to the development of both individually held and collectively shared knowledge.\nMy primary focus of research in the domain of team cognition is thus directly oriented towards specifying and studying the dynamic processes involved in developing team cognition. In some of my initial work in this domain, my colleagues and I advanced a formal theory and computational model that elaborated several core concepts and mechanisms of knowledge emergence in teams. Our simulations with the model revealed several leverage points for facilitating convergent team cognition, such as improving the rates at which individual members learn information and regulating the rates at which information is shared/exchanged by individuals. We then constructed a novel team knowledge-building task and conducted an empirical study which lent support to these model predictions and therefore the core model mechanisms. In future research in this domain, I am interested in further examining the effects of individual vs. joint attention, the role of path dependence in team knowledge and decision-making (i.e., extent to which previously known/shared information and decisions shapes subsequent attention to information and choices by teams), and incorporating the effects of goals and differences in individuals' understanding of \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; interpretations impact the emergence of collective knowledge.\n","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"f0c78b6a511e4c29abd728bf58f74479","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/team-knowledge-emergence/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/team-knowledge-emergence/","section":"project","summary":"Formal theory, measurement/analytic techniques, and empirical research on how knowledge emerges and is used by teams","tags":["Teams","Computational Modeling","Ongoing"],"title":"Emergence of collective and distributed knowledge in teams","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Sources  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  Award #: 1R18HS020295-01 Award #: 1R18HS022458-01A1   Defense Medical Research and Development Program, JPC-1  Award #: W81XWH-15-1-0403   Defense Medical Research and Development Program, JPC-1  Award #: W81XWH-18-1-0089    Key Collaborators  Rose Fernandez (Univ of Florida) Liza Rosenman (Univ of Washington) Steve Kozlowski (Univ of South Florida) Georgia Chao (Univ of South Florida)  Summary The contemporary healthcare system is often described as a “team sport” that relies heavily on coordination within and between teams of medical professionals to deliver patient care and manage increasingly complex processes. To this end, communication, teamwork skills, and effective team leadership have emerged as crucial elements to the provision of high quality healthcare and patient safety than ever before. Indeed, failures in these crucial aspects of team functioning have been directly linked with both increased medical errors and adverse patient events. Unfortunately, training and well-validated instructional guidance for developing effective team and leadership skills is a comparatively small component of most medical and continuing education programs.\nWorking closely with collaborators across a variety of healthcare disciplines, I design and conduct validation studies that target the development of generalizable training, assessment, and feedback methods aimed at improving the teamwork and leadership skills of healthcare professionals. The majority of work I conduct in this area is in emergency medicine contexts, in which individuals are tasked with working as part of ad hoc, multidisciplinary teams to perform complex patient care and medical decision-making under dynamic and time pressured conditions. These factors present considerable challenges for both team communication and coordination, and thus pose significant threats to patient safety.\nWithin this line of research, my colleagues and I focus heavily on improving the quality and effectiveness of simulation-based training techniques (i.e., using artificial patients/scenarios as a stimulus for trainees to learn and practice skills) for improving the team and leadership capabilities of medical students/residents. Through this research stream, we focus on developing accessible and generalizable recommendations/guidance on how to structure training opportunities, assessment and evaluative methodologies, and deliver feedback to learners that can be implemented by both medical researchers and educators. Additionally, we have developed multiple team skills and leadership training programs, and have demonstrated that the behaviors/skills taught in our simulation-based trainings transfer to actual care settings with real patients and exhibit a measureable impact on the quality of medical care provided.\n","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"139ed15b78fee4c745108f940e4426c1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/translational-sim-training/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/translational-sim-training/","section":"project","summary":"Developmment and evaluation of simluation-based training, assessment, and feedback for improving healthcare","tags":["Teams","Training","Ongoing"],"title":"Facilitating the transfer and impact of team and leadership training on patient outcomes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary From political leaders to CEOs to front-line employees, there is widespread recognition that the capacity to make effective decisions and accurate judgments is a sign of competence and expertise. For example, consider the following scenario and potential responses one might take:\n You and someone from another department are jointly responsible for coordinating a project involving both departments. The other person is not carrying out his share of the responsibilities. How would you deal with this situation?\n Discuss the situation with your manager and ask him to take it up with the other person\u0026rsquo;s manager. Remind him that you need his help and that the project won\u0026rsquo;t be completed effectively without a full team effort from both of you. Try to find out why he is not doing his share and explain to him that this creates more work for you and makes it harder to finish the project. Get someone else from his department to help with the project.   Which of these actions do you believe would be most effective? Least effective? Why? How did your reach that conclusion? How would you interpret a person\u0026rsquo;s responses to this question?\nThe scenario and response options shown above is an example of an item that might be found on a situational judgement test (SJT). SJTs most commonly present respondents with a series of scenarios that reflect possible circumstances, tasks, or decisions that might be experienced in a particular context. Each scenario is accompanied by a set of possible actions that the respondent is asked to evaluate and choose among. Because of their practical and predictive value, SJTs are commonly used in many personnel assessment contexts including selection and training evaluation. Nevertheless, there are many fundamental questions related to the use and design of SJTs. Perhaps most significantly, there is still uncertainty regarding how to interpret the meaning of \u0026ldquo;performance\u0026rdquo; on an SJT. Similar uncertainties exist regarding how the construction or presentation of an SJT item might influence respondents’ choices and subsequent interpretation of scores.\nThe main purpose and motivation of this research is to better understand the judgment and decision-making processes underlying SJT responding. Through studying the psychological mechanisms of SJT responding, I hope to provide insight and potential recommendations that can be used to inform the scoring, interpretation, and design of SJTs. To this end, I have proposed a formal theory and computational model of what I believe represents the cognitive processes used by respondents to answer SJT items known as SiRJ (Situated Reasoning and Judgment). Simulation studies conducted with the model reveal considerable correspondence with existing empirical evidence. I have also gathered additional data using eye tracking that provides further support for several of the model\u0026rsquo;s predictions.\n","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"6bf5dd43e0e75281a3f68d52cb55174c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/sjt-response-process/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sjt-response-process/","section":"project","summary":"Developing theory and conducting empirical examinations of the judgment and decision-making process underlying response selection on situational judgment tests","tags":["Assessment","Computational Modeling","Ongoing"],"title":"Information processing accounts for situational judgment test responding","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rSPACE\rThe Grand Lab is housed in a 520-square foot office suite on the third floor of the Biology-Psychology Building at the University of Maryland.

My primary research interests within this context largely fall into two streams of activity:\n  Developing formal theories and evaluating evidence-based interventions for understanding and enhancing the effectiveness of teams and organizations Developing and evaluating formal theories models of the psychological processes and situational factors that influence learning and assessment outcomes for individuals   I am often inspired by and frequently draw upon ideas found in disciplines outside of organizational psychology in my research, including general systems theory, network science, computer science, sociology, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. Additionally\u0026ndash;or perhaps as a result\u0026ndash;I enjoy learning about and applying a variety of methodological/analytical techniques in my work (e.g., computational modeling, Bayesian modeling, network analyses, machine learning, behavioral trace data, eye tracking).\nBeyond my interest in advancing basic research on these topics, I also devote considerable attention to working with and communicating my work to other non-psychology disciplines and outlets. In particular, I have worked closely with professionals and educators in health care and emergency medicine to develop training and assessment tools that target leadership, team functioning, and team effectiveness.\nFor more information and specific examples of the research I conduct, please take a look at some of my recent projects and publications. \rRESEARCH PHILOSOPHY The sections below describe my core values, preferences, and beliefs regarding how I do my research. These statements are intended to convey both how I see myself as a scientist and the principles/practices I attempt to follow when engaging in all aspects of the research process. If you are interested in working with me as a student or a collaborator, this material should hopefully provide a good idea of what it might be like to work together. Additionally, if you are interested in developing a research philosophy statement of your own, you may like this paper written by my colleagues and I where we discuss the purpose and value of such a document.\nResearch Orientation A guiding principle of my scholarly activity is my belief in the significance of studying social and organizational phenomena as complex systems. This perspective recognizes that the internal states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, perceptions) and outward expressions (e.g., behaviors, decisions) of individuals shape and are shaped by interactions with our environment and those within it. Played out over time and across individuals, these psychological processes and their resultant consequences can coalesce into emergent structures (e.g., temperaments, roles, relational networks) and experienced patterns (e.g., norms, culture, beliefs) capable of influencing the way in which individuals feel, think, and act. These recurrent “micro↔macro” forces inherent in complex dynamic systems are meaningful and relevant for understanding virtually all psychological phenomena across nearly all levels of explanation (i.e., individuals, teams, multi-team systems, organizations, etc.).\nIrrespective of its focal application, the critical point emphasized by this perspective is that scientific knowledge is advanced by attempting to precisely describe, document, and study the generative processes that produce, sustain, and influence dynamic and emergent outcomes—or as Nobel Laureate and theoretical physicist Richard Feynman summarized: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” Consequently, the research I conduct is directly motivated by (a) a desire to advance understanding of psychological phenomena from the perspective of dynamic processes rather than static effects; (b) advance, advocate for, and develop resources for methodologies that promote this perspective; and (c) contribute to foundational knowledge on substantive topics of interest from this perspective that can be leveraged to advance evidence-based solutions.\n\r Professional Identity I identify as a scientist. To me, that means I derive my professional fulfillment from the pursuit of knowledge and efforts to better understand the natural world. The scientific community with which I am most closely affiliated and to whom I primarily contribute is the organizational sciences. However, I am inspired by and continually aspire to learn from several scientific communities, including the cognitive sciences, computer sciences, ecological sciences, planetary sciences, and applied physics/mathematics. It is important to me to devote time and effort into learning from scientific communities that are not my primary academic community as I believe it improves my scholarship, the questions I ask, and the methodologies I apply.\n\n Scholarship The broader philosophical orientation towards process in my substantive research is reflected in how I carry out my scholarly activities. Much of my research embraces and seeks to contribute to principles of computational social science that uses computational/quantitative modeling techniques to capture, analyze, and develop more rigorous, precise, and formal theories of social and organizational phenomena. Consequently, a significant thrust of my attention is directed towards basic theory development, validation, and advancing computational methodologies. Additionally, I also direct attention towards and participate in interdisciplinary collaborations on more applied research (primarily in emergency medicine and healthcare) that seeks to develop evidence-based solutions to “real world” issues.\n\n Data Sources \u0026amp; Preferred Research Methodologies The majority of data I collect for my research is original/primary source, though I also regularly make use of archival and simulated data as well. My research makes equal use of both laboratory (i.e., primarily college student populations) and field (i.e., working professionals) data. Furthermore, I strongly emphasize the collection of behavioral and/or observational data in all my research and, where applicable, longitudinal/within-unit data. Although perception/questionnaire-based data has a long and rich history in psychology, I believe that the organizational and social sciences relies too heavily on the use of cross-sectional, single-time point, and self-report survey methodologies. Consequently, much of my research relies on such data sources only for secondary/supplementary purposes.\n\n Publication Goals \u0026amp; Preferences For my research that is directed towards more “basic”/foundational knowledge, I typically prefer a more comprehensive publication strategy in which I present new (often computational) theory paired with one or more data sources designed to evaluate its core propositions. In my research that is directed towards more “applied”/evidence-based knowledge however, I typically prefer a more concise paper with a more tightly defined research foci and accompanying data. I generally prefer not to parse large datasets into multiple papers unless there is reasonable justification for doing so (e.g., paper would be too dense/large to effectively communicate all findings).\n\n Robust Science Participation I am an advocate of and participant in open science practices that place greater emphasis on how research is accomplished (i.e., process) relative to its outcomes (i.e., publications, impact factors, citations). When I am not limited by either confidentiality or ethical concerns, I make every effort to share my research materials, data, and analyses using publicly accessible repositories (e.g., Open Science Framework, GitHub) and this website. I believe an essential component of my job as a scientist is to create clear and useful documentation, comments/notes, and guides for other researchers related to my data, analyses, and models. Further, I believe that replication, reproducibility, and related efforts to minimize the potential for questionable research practices are imperative to the long-term health and success of science. Nevertheless, I am also a strong advocate for inductive and abductive research that promotes idea generation and stimulates new perspectives. To the extent such research is recognized, discussed, and presented as the impetus for knowledge generation rather than a confirmatory/deductive evaluation, I believe such efforts are absolutely critical to the scientific ecosystem and should be recognized for their importance.\n\n Collaboration I believe strongly in the power and effectiveness of “team” science; that is, the quality (and enjoyment!) of research is greatly improved through collaborative efforts among diverse and engaged scholars. Furthermore, I believe there are very few (if any) reasons why institutions or policies should exist that discourage engaging in productive collaborations with other researchers and/or practitioners, including previous mentors/advisors or students. My job is to contribute to the development of knowledge, understanding, and evidence-based solutions; to the extent one accomplishes this though rich collaborations, they should be fostered and encouraged. I generally prefer to maintain a relatively small (~6-8) rather than a large network of collaborators when conducting my research. I believe strongly in investing and reciprocating my time, effort, and resources into developing high quality collaborative partnerships and find I am able to accomplish this more effectively working in smaller groups.\n\n Authorship I attempt to adhere to the American Psychological Association’s code of ethics (Section 8.12) regarding authorship that relies on an individual’s contribution for determining author order. That said, I also do not believe that authorship order is as significant as we make it out to be. I believe that science and the generation of valued knowledge is frequently an emergent product of team-based collaboration. Dissecting and seeking to reduce this “whole” into the “parts” that members contributed to is often difficult at best and counterproductive at worst. Furthermore, there are occasions in which I may “undervalue” my contribution to provide opportunities and/or voice to those who would likely benefit more from the normative recognition that comes with higher authorship. In particular, I rarely list myself ahead of my graduate students on any publications together unless they only contributed to the collection/analysis of data. I also strongly encourage and advocate for my students to publish their theses/dissertations without me listed as an author unless they would prefer otherwise.\n\n ","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"8f6b382fe2cfc9359db0174f55f8ad53","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/research-overview/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/research-overview/","section":"research","summary":"INTERESTS \u0026amp; INSPIRATIONS As an organizational psychologist, I am interested in developing basic knowledge about human cognition, affect, and behavior that can be used to improve the effectiveness and well-being of employees and organizations.","tags":null,"title":"RESEARCH OVERVIEW","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Sources  Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences  Award #: W911NF-18-2-0049    Key Collaborators  Paul Hanges (Univ of Maryland) Steve Stark (Univ of South Florida)  Summary Historically, researchers have focused on positive leadership attributes; attributes believed to lead to organizational and follower effectiveness. The underlying assumption inherent in this research was that dysfunctional leadership was the absence of effective leadership. This changed, however, around the turn of the millennium, when organizational science began to directly focus on negative leadership styles. Various negative styles such as abusive supervision, destructive leadership, toxic leadershi, and petty tyranny (among otheres) have since been identified and scales measuring these constructs designed.\nHowever, one difficulty when having respondents rate such undesirable behavior is that obtained scores are more prone to distortion from socially desirable responding. Forced-choice methodologies have been proposed as one promising method for reducing social desirability bias in scale scores. Specifically, forced-choice formats consist of sets of statements which have been matched in terms of social desirability from which respondents must choose one statement that is most characteristic of themselves or a focal target (e.g., a leader, a team member, etc.). Although useful for reducing certain response biases, conventional methods for scoring forced-choice scales cannot be used as they provide ipsative or partially ipsative data (i.e., total score on measure is constant for all examinees). Consequently, an alternative model for evaluating forced-choice data based on an ideal-point IRT model is recommended to produce scores that can be meaningfully used to differentiate between individuals. Unfortunately, a significant challenge in creating forced-choice instruments is writing items that conform to the ideal-point model. For example, recent work has demonstrated that items tend to conform to the ideal-point model if they describe typical or average level of behavior or if the items are double-barreled, but there is little guidance on how to appropriately construct and scale these items across a continuum. Consequently, to realize the full benefits of forced-choice data based on ideal-point responding, there is a notable need for research on the nature of forced-choice responding that can be used to inform better test construction practices.\nOur research attempted to address this need in the context of leadership assessment. By proposing and applying a psychological model of the proposed response processes used by individuals when making selections to forced-choice items, we developed a large bank of forced-choice items relevant to assessing both positive and negative aspects of leadership behavior that would better conform to an ideal-point model. We next conducted several empirical studies to establish the construct validity of our forced-choice scales and compare it to existing Likert-based scales of destructive leadership. Results revealed that our forced-choice scale demonstrated substantially lower method bias, strong convergent and discriminant validity, and was significantly correlated with respondents' reports of counterproductive work behaivors.

It is unknown whether provider gender-based differences in team leadership exist. The objective of this study was to assess and compare team leadership and patient care in trauma resuscitations led by male and female providers.\n**Methods:** We performed a secondary analysis of data from a larger randomized controlled trial using video recordings of emergency department trauma resuscitations at a Level 1 trauma center from April 2016 to December 2017. Subjects included emergency medicine and surgery residents functioning as trauma team leaders. Eligible resuscitations included adult patients meeting institutional trauma activation criteria. Two video-recorded observations for each participant were coded for team leadership quality and patient care by 2 sets of raters. Raters were balanced with regard to gender and were blinded to study hypotheses. We used Bayesian regression to determine whether our data supported gender-based advantages in team leadership.\n**Results:** A total of 60 participants and 120 video recorded observations were included. The modal relationship between gender and team leadership (β = 0.94, 95% highest density interval [HDI], -.68, 2.52) and gender and patient care (β=2.42, 95%HDI, -2.03, 6.78) revealed a weak positive effect for female leaders on both outcomes. Gender based advantages to team leadership and clinical care were not conclusively supported or refuted, with the exception of rejecting a strong male advantage to team leadership.\n**Conclusions:** We prospectively measured team leadership and clinical care during patient care. Our findings do not support differences in trauma resuscitation team leadership or clinical care based on the gender of the team leader.","tags":["Healthcare","Leadership","Stereotypes"],"title":"Does team leader gender matter?

Despite their prevalence, many questions regarding how to interpret respondent choices or how variations in item construction and instruction influence the nature of observed responses remain. Existing conceptual and empirical efforts to explore these questions have largely been rooted in reflexive psychometric measurement models that describe participant responses as indicative of (usually multiple) latent constructs. However, some have suggested that a key to better understanding SJT responses lies in unpacking the judgment and decision-making processes employed by respondents and the psychological and contextual factors that shape how those processes play out. To this end, the present paper advances an integrative and generalizable process-oriented theory of SJT responding. The framework, labeled Situated Reasoning and Judgment (SiRJ), proposes that respondents engage in a series of conditional reasoning, similarity, and preference accumulation judgments when deciding how to evaluate and respond to an SJT item. To evaluate the theory’s plausibility and utility, the SiRJ framework is translated into a formal computational model and results from a simulation study are analyzed using neural network and Bayesian survival analytic techniques that demonstrate its capability to replicate existing and new empirical effects, suggest insights into SJT interpretation and development, and stimulate new directions for future research.

Results revealed that gender differences in external hiring heightened women's sense of tokenism and their turnover rates and that bias in developmental opportunities increased women's turnover rates due to a lack of promotions - a “sticky floor” effect. Further, improving women's leadership representation in gender-stratified organizations may be a rocky road – positive impacts were preceded by elevated turnover for women.

There has been increased focus on competency in team leadership behaviors; however, there is still variability in how team leadership is assessed within emergency medicine. The objective of this study was to develop and pilot a novel team leadership assessment measure for emergency medicine resuscitation teams.\n**Methods:** Team leadership dimensions and associated behaviors were identified through a systematic literature review and expert consensus. Included behaviors were used to create behaviorally anchored rating scales, which were then revised based on subject matter expert ratings. Four raters from three different academic institutions observed 30 video-recorded resuscitations (20 simulated and 10 actual patient care resuscitations). Mean leadership scores were calculated. Intraclass coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for each item and for overall leadership scores. Leader scores for the simulation-based scenarios were compared to external variables including level of training, team process, clinical performance, and team situational awareness. The study was conducted from July 2017 through June 2018.\n**Results:** Leadership scores ranged from 2.23 to 4.30 (mean [±SD] = 3.18 [±0.50]). The ICC for the overall score was 0.79 for all observations, 0.87 for simulation-based observations, and 0.24 for the patient care observations. Team leadership scores on simulation-based observations did not correlate with available external variables.\n**Conclusions:** We developed a novel team leadership assessment measure for emergency medicine resuscitation teams with supporting validity evidence, including content validity and response process. The measure demonstrated acceptable inter-rater reliability when applied to simulation-based medical resuscitations; however, this did not translate to trauma resuscitations in the actual patient care setting.","tags":["Health Care","Leadership"],"title":"Development and empirical testing of a novel team leadership assessment measure: A pilot study using simulated and live patient encounters","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

At the root of this interest is concern over the reproducibility of key findings. A variety of large-scale replication attempts have revealed that several previously published effects cannot be reproduced, whereas other analyses indicate that the published literature is rife with underpowered studies and publication bias. These revelations suggest that it is time to change how psychological science is carried out and increase the transparency of reporting. We argue that change will be slow until institutions adopt new procedures for evaluating scholarly activity. We consider three actions that individuals and departments can take to facilitate change throughout psychological science: the development of individualized research-philosophy statements, the creation of an annotated curriculum vitae to improve the transparency of scholarly reporting, and the use of a formal evaluative system that explicitly captures behaviors that support reproducibility. Our recommendations build on proposals for open science by enabling researchers to have a voice in articulating (and contextualizing) how they would like their work to be evaluated and by providing a mechanism for more detailed and transparent reporting of scholarly activities.","tags":["Research Evaluation","Annotated CV","Research Philosophy"],"title":"Making research evaluation more transparent: Aligning research philosophy, departmental values, and reporting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A.

We posit that a significant value of RR and RBR is their potential to promote a greater focus on the research process (i.e., how and why research is conducted) relative to research outcomes (i.e., what was observed or concluded from research).

Simulation provides a platform for developing and assessing TSA, but these efforts are limited by suboptimal measurement approaches. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel approach to TSA measurement in interprofessional emergency medicine (EM) teams.\n**Methods:** We performed a multicenter, prospective, simulation-based observational study to evaluate an approach to TSA measurement. Interprofessional emergency medical teams, consisting of EM resident physicians, nurses, and medical students, were recruited from the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) and Wayne State University (Detroit, MI). Each team completed a simulated emergency resuscitation scenario. Immediately following the simulation, team members completed a TSA measure, a team perception of shared understanding measure, and a team leader effectiveness measure. Subject matter expert reviews and pilot testing of the TSA measure provided evidence of content and response process validity. Simulations were recorded and independently coded for team performance using a previously validated measure. The relationships between the TSA measure and other variables (team clinical performance, team perception of shared understanding, team leader effectiveness, and team experience) were explored. The TSA agreement metric was indexed by averaging the pairwise agreement for each dyad on a team and then averaging across dyads to yield agreement at the team level. For the team perception of shared understanding and team leadership effectiveness measures, individual team member scores were aggregated within a team to create a single team score. We computed descriptive statistics for all outcomes.

However, the motivating force behind our commentary has less to do with the issues raised by Tett et al. (2017) concerning the practice of using meta-analysis for purposes of validity generalization and more to do with the practice of using meta-analysis for purposes of scientific inference. Between-person philosophies in which the end-goal is to identify general conclusions that apply to the aggregate (cf. Hanges \u0026 Wang, 2012) have historically guided our scientific inferences and have supported the proliferation of meta-analytic techniques (including what Tett et al. describe as tertiary analyses based on such findings). These philosophies have led to a dearth of understanding at the within-person and social system levels—the levels at which most of our meaningful phenomena exist (e.g., Hamaker, 2012; Von Bertalanffy, 1950). Learning, performing, decision making, communicating, sense-making, feeling/expressing emotion: These are the concepts that drive the lived experiences of individuals both inside and outside of the workplace, and all are vulnerable to being misunderstood or misinterpreted by focusing only on aggregate evidence at the between-person level. Consequently, we wish to first supplement Tett et al.’s recommendations for drawing generalizability inferences in meta-analysis and suggest a “pre-emptive” question (i.e., Question 0) to the list of four they advance in their focal article.","tags":["Meta-analysis","Philosophy of Science"],"title":"\"Life doesn't happen at the between-person level,\" or a cautionary note on generating scientific inferences through meta-analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Marie Ryan","Matthew C.

Study 1 involved (a) qualitative review of published literature, professional codes of ethics, and critical incidents of (un)ethical performance and resulted in (b) behavioral dimensions and ethical performance rating scales. The second and third studies used a retranslation methodology to evaluate the ethical performance dimensions from Study 1. The behavioral dimensions were linked to the performance determinants (personal attributes) in Study 3.\n**Findings:** Study 1 resulted in draft dimension definitions and rating scales for 10 ethical performance dimensions. In Studies 2 and 3, retranslation data provided strong support for 10 behavioral dimensions of ethical performance at work. Results from Study 3 shed light on possible relationships among the performance dimensions based on their underlying performance determinants.\n**Implications:** Communicating an organization’s ethical standards to employees is important because some ethical breakdowns can be attributed to simply failing to recognize an ethical matter (in: DeCremer, Managerial ethics: Managing the psychology of morality, Routledge, New York, 2011). Definitions of ethical behavior in the workplace provide a tool for researchers, employers, and employees to communicate about ethical situations and a foundation for folding ethics into employee training and performance management.\n**Originality/Value:** These studies provide a taxonomy of ethical performance at work that generalizes to a diverse array of occupations and industries, and dimensions and rating scales have value for performance management, training/curriculum development, job analysis, predictor development and/or validation, and additional research.","tags":["Ethics","Ethical Behavior"],"title":"Situating ethical behavior in the nomological network of job performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Gittinger","Sarah M Brolliar","James A.

Patient management was coded using an Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support-based checklist. Team communication was categorized in the following 4 areas: (1) teamwork focus; (2) huddle events, defined as statements focused on re-establishing situation awareness, reinforcing existing plans, and assessing the need to adjust the plan; (3) clinical focus; and (4) profession of team member. Statements were aggregated for each team.\n**Results:** At baseline, groups were similar with respect to total communication statements and patient management. During cardiac arrest, the total number of communication statements was greater in teams performing manual compressions (median, 152.3; interquartile range [IQR], 127.6-181.0) as compared with teams using an automated compression device (median, 105; IQR, 99.5-123.9).

Empirical work in this area has primarily examined the impact of negative stereotypes on performance for threatened individuals. However, this body of research seldom acknowledges that performance is a function of learning—which may also be impaired by pervasive group stereotypes. This study presents evidence from a 3-day self-guided training program demonstrating that stereotype threat impairs acquisition of cognitive learning outcomes for females facing a negative group stereotype. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, results revealed that stereotyped females demonstrated poorer declarative knowledge acquisition, spent less time reflecting on learning activities, and developed less efficiently organized knowledge structures compared with females in a control condition. Findings from a Bayesian mediation model also suggested that despite stereotyped individuals “working harder” to perform well, their underachievement was largely attributable to failures in learning to “work smarter.” Building upon these empirical results, a computational model and computer simulation is also presented to demonstrate the practical significance of stereotype-induced impairments to learning on the development of an organization’s human capital resources and capabilities. The simulation results show that even the presence of small effects of stereotype threat during learning/training have the potential to exert a significant negative impact on an organization’s performance potential. Implications for future research and practice examining stereotype threat during learning are discussed.","tags":["Stereotypes","Stereotype Threat"],"title":"Brain drain?

However, theory and research in this domain continues to remain largely static; articulation and examination of the dynamic processes through which collectively held knowledge emerges from the individual- to the team-level is lacking. To address this gap, we advance and systematically evaluate a process-oriented theory of team knowledge emergence. First, we summarize the core concepts and dynamic mechanisms that underlie team knowledge-building and represent our theory of team knowledge emergence (Step 1). We then translate this narrative theory into a formal computational model that provides an explicit specification of how these core concepts and mechanisms interact to produce emergent team knowledge (Step 2). The computational model is next instantiated into an agent-based simulation to explore how the key generative process mechanisms described in our theory contribute to improved knowledge emergence in teams (Step 3). Results from the simulations demonstrate that agent teams generate collectively shared knowledge more effectively when members are capable of processing information more efficiently and when teams follow communication strategies that promote equal rates of information sharing across members. Lastly, we conduct an empirical experiment with real teams participating in a collective knowledge-building task to verify that promoting these processes in human teams also leads to improved team knowledge emergence (Step 4). Discussion focuses on implications of the theory for examining team cognition processes and dynamics as well as directions for future research.","tags":["Agent-based Modeling","Team Cognition"],"title":"The dynamics of team cognition: A process-oriented theory of knowledge emergence in teams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steve W.

Skill and demographic shifts among labor market occupants and changes in job and occupational requirements have led employers to source applicants for jobs in wider markets (and even globally).  Technological developments have facilitated and accelerated staffing processes. Greater use of computer- and particularly Internet-based testing has provided organizations with greater efficiency in resource allocation, quicker processing of applicants, and access to a larger pool of potential applicants.  Technology has allowed for new and varied ways of presenting assessment content to applicants, but has also heightened concerns regarding test security and potential cheating. Given that these trends have reshaped hiring and staffing over the past 20 years, this chapter provides an updated description of the practices and policies used by organizations around the world. A 54-item survey on selection practices was translated into 15 languages and data was collected from HR professionals in more than 25 countries.

Teamwork behavior items (e.g., \\'chest radiograph findings communicated to team\\' and \\'team member assists with intubation preparation\\') were standardized before combining to create overall teamwork scores.

Most quantitative research examines top-down, contextual, cross-level relationships. Emergent phenomena that manifest from the bottom up from the psychological characteristics, processes, and interactions among individuals—although examined qualitatively—have been largely neglected in quantitative research. Emergence is theoretically assumed, examined indirectly, and treated as an inference regarding the construct validity of higher level measures. As a result, quantitative researchers are investigating only one fundamental process of multilevel theory and organizational systems. This article advances more direct, dynamic, and temporally sensitive quantitative research methods designed to unpack emergence as a process. We argue that direct quantitative approaches, largely represented by computational modeling or agent-based simulation, have much to offer with respect to illuminating the mechanisms of emergence as a dynamic process. We illustrate how indirect and direct approaches can be complementary and, appropriately integrated, have the potential to substantially advance theory and research.

However, the stereotype threat literature suggests adding job relevant context to tests could negatively impact the performance of women if that context is traditionally male stereotyped. To test this prediction, 345 participants (n = 236 female) completed either a face valid or generic version of a mathematical and mechanical ability test under conditions of explicit or no explicit stereotype threat. Contrary to stereotype threat theory predictions, face validity had either beneficial or nonsignificant effects on test performance and test perceptions and did not affect the psychometric properties of either test. Implications and recommendations for future research regarding the study of face validity and stereotype threat are discussed.","tags":["Stereotypes","Stereotype Threat","Cognitive Ability"],"title":"How far does stereotype threat reach?

However, the widespread acceptance of this viewpoint has led to the perception of Asian Americans as robotic, emotionless workers and human beings, subsequently affecting their ability to gain cultural and societal acceptance and achieve upward economic and social mobility. This chapter specifically explores the impact of the Model Minority Myth in the workplace and its resulting implications for career development. The description begins with a general discussion of the nature of stereotype development and evaluation, helping to set the stage for a more specific explication of the Model Minority Myth and other relevant Asian American stereotypes. The final half of the work discusses the potential consequences of the Model Minority Myth on various processes of normal organizational functioning, including selection, organizational entry and socialization, personnel training, performance appraisal, and mentoring. The chapter closes with a brief discussion of future research questions for the field with the goal of continuing to shed new light on the phenomenon and possible ways in which the Model Minority Myth can be overcome in organizations.","tags":["Stereotypes"],"title":"Career and work implications of the model minority myth and other stereotypes for Asian Americans","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
