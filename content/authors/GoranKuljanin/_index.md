 Goran Kuljanin serves as an assistant professor in the Department of Management & Entrepreneurship in the Driehaus College of Business at DePaul University. He teaches courses on business and people analytics, human resources management and organizational behavior. Before joining the business college, he received two nominations for Mentor of the Year in DePaul's College of Science and Health. 

 Kuljanin’s research focuses on applying computational theorizing and modeling to investigate human resources management (HRM) and organizational behavioral (OB) processes and the emergence of HRM and OB phenomena, investigating and using dynamical models in HRM and OB, describing the utility of data science to advance HRM and OB research and practice, and studying team composition, processes, and emergent states and outcomes. He has published his research in the Journal of Applied Psychology, Psychological Methods, and Organizational Research Methods. His research awards include Best Article in Organizational Research Methods in 2013, the 2015 William A. Owens Scholarly Achievement Award from SIOP, and a Monograph Distinction from the Journal of Applied Psychology. As a co-investigator, Kuljanin has won grants from the U.S. Army Research Institute for the behavioral and social sciences.

Kuljanin’s consulting work focuses on analyzing data on any organization’s most important resource: its people. In particular, his consulting involves applying advanced analytics (e.g., machine learning, dynamical modeling, organizational network analysis, computational modeling) on employee, team, unit and organizational data to develop adaptively effective HRM and OB strategies for organizational objectives. This includes consulting and leading training seminars on job and work analysis, job placement, employee staffing, employee training and development, motivation, teamwork, leadership and business and people analytics.
