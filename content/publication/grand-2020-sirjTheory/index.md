abstract: Situational judgment tests (SJTs) have emerged as a staple of assessment
  methodologies for organizational practitioners and researchers. Despite their prevalence,
  many questions regarding how to interpret respondent choices or how variations in
  item construction and instruction influence the nature of observed responses remain.
  Existing conceptual and empirical efforts to explore these questions have largely
  been rooted in reflexive psychometric measurement models that describe participant
  responses as indicative of (usually multiple) latent constructs. However, some have
  suggested that a key to better understanding SJT responses lies in unpacking the
  judgment and decision-making processes employed by respondents and the psychological
  and contextual factors that shape how those processes play out. To this end, the
  present paper advances an integrative and generalizable process-oriented theory
  of SJT responding. The framework, labeled Situated Reasoning and Judgment (SiRJ),
  proposes that respondents engage in a series of conditional reasoning, similarity,
  and preference accumulation judgments when deciding how to evaluate and respond
  to an SJT item. To evaluate the theoryâ€™s plausibility and utility, the SiRJ framework
  is translated into a formal computational model and results from a simulation study
  are analyzed using neural network and Bayesian survival analytic techniques that
  demonstrate its capability to replicate existing and new empirical effects, suggest
  insights into SJT interpretation and development, and stimulate new directions for
  future research. An interactive web application that allows users to explore the
  computational model developed for SiRJ [https://grandjam.shinyapps.io/sirj](https://grandjam.shinyapps.io/sirj) as well
  as all reported data and the full model/simulation code [https://osf.io/uwdfm/](https://osf.io/uwdfm/)
  are also provided.
