abstract: "**Objectives:** Team situational awareness (TSA) is critical for effective
   teamwork and supports dynamic decision making in unpredictable, time-pressured
   situations. Simulation provides a platform for developing and assessing TSA, but
   these efforts are limited by suboptimal measurement approaches. The objective
   of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel approach to TSA measurement
   in interprofessional emergency medicine (EM) teams.<br /><br />
   **Methods:** We performed a multicenter, prospective, simulation-based observational study to evaluate an approach to TSA
   measurement. Interprofessional emergency medical teams, consisting of EM resident
   physicians, nurses, and medical students, were recruited from the University of
   Washington (Seattle, WA) and Wayne State University (Detroit, MI). Each team completed
   a simulated emergency resuscitation scenario. Immediately following the simulation,
   team members completed a TSA measure, a team perception of shared understanding
   measure, and a team leader effectiveness measure. Subject matter expert reviews
   and pilot testing of the TSA measure provided evidence of content and response
   process validity. Simulations were recorded and independently coded for team performance
   using a previously validated measure. The relationships between the TSA measure
   and other variables (team clinical performance, team perception of shared understanding,
   team leader effectiveness, and team experience) were explored. The TSA agreement
   metric was indexed by averaging the pairwise agreement for each dyad on a team
   and then averaging across dyads to yield agreement at the team level. For the
   team perception of shared understanding and team leadership effectiveness measures,
   individual team member scores were aggregated within a team to create a single
   team score. We computed descriptive statistics for all outcomes. We calculated
   Pearson's product-moment correlations to determine bivariate correlations between
   outcome variables with two-tailed significance testing (p < 0.05).<br /><br />
   **Results:** A total of 123 participants were recruited and formed three-person teams (n =
   41 teams). All teams completed the assessment scenario and postsimulation measures.
   TSA agreement ranged from 0.19 to 0.9 and had a mean (±SD) of 0.61 (±0.17). TSA
   correlated with team clinical performance (p < 0.05) but did not correlate
   with team perception of shared understanding, team leader effectiveness, or team
   experience.<br /><br />
   **Conclusions:** Team situational awareness supports adaptive teams and
   is critical for high reliability organizations such as healthcare systems. Simulation
   can provide a platform for research aimed at understanding and measuring TSA.
   This study provides a feasible method for simulation-based assessment of TSA in
   interdisciplinary teams that addresses prior measure limitations and is appropriate
   for use in highly dynamic, uncertain situations commonly encountered in emergency
   department systems. Future research is needed to understand the development of
   and interactions between individual-, team-, and system (distributed)-level cognitive
   processes."
