abstract: '**Introduction:** This pilot study used a simulation-based platform to evaluate
  the effect of an automated mechanical chest compression device on team communication
  and patient management.<br /><br />
  **Methods:** Four-member emergency department interprofessional
  teams were randomly assigned to perform manual chest compressions (control, n =
  6) or automated chest compressions (intervention, n = 6) during a simulated cardiac
  arrest with 2 phases: phase 1 baseline (ventricular tachycardia), followed by phase
  2 (ventricular fibrillation). Patient management was coded using an Advanced Cardiovascular
  Life Support-based checklist. Team communication was categorized in the following
  4 areas: (1) teamwork focus; (2) huddle events, defined as statements focused on
  re-establishing situation awareness, reinforcing existing plans, and assessing the
  need to adjust the plan; (3) clinical focus; and (4) profession of team member.
  Statements were aggregated for each team.<br /><br />
  **Results:** At baseline, groups were similar with respect to total communication statements and patient management. During cardiac
  arrest, the total number of communication statements was greater in teams performing
  manual compressions (median, 152.3; interquartile range [IQR], 127.6-181.0) as compared
  with teams using an automated compression device (median, 105; IQR, 99.5-123.9).
  Huddle events were more frequent in teams performing automated chest compressions
  (median, 4.0; IQR, 3.1-4.3 vs. 2.0; IQR, 1.4-2.6). Teams randomized to the automated
  compression intervention had a delay to initial defibrillation (median, 208.3 seconds;
  IQR, 153.3-222.1 seconds) as compared with control teams (median, 63.2 seconds;
  IQR, 30.1-397.2 seconds).<br /><br />
  **Conclusions:** Use of an automated compression device may
  impact both team communication and patient management. Simulation-based assessments
  offer important insights into the effect of technology on healthcare teams.'
