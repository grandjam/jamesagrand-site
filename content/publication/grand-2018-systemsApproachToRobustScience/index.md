abstract: Credibility and trustworthiness are the bedrock upon which any science is
  built. The strength of these foundations has been increasingly questioned across
  the sciences as instances of research misconduct and mounting concerns over the
  prevalence of detrimental research practices have been identified. Consequently,
  the purpose of this article is to encourage our scientific community to positively
  and proactively engage in efforts that foster a healthy and robust industrial and
  organizational (I-O) psychology. We begin by advancing six defining principles that
  we believe reflect the values of robust science and offer criteria for evaluating
  proposed efforts to change scientific practices. Recognizing that the contemporary
  scientific enterprise is a complex and diverse network of actors and institutions,
  we then conclude by identifying 12 stakeholders who play important roles in achieving
  a culture of robust science in I-O psychology and offer recommendations for actions
  we can take as members of these groups to strengthen our science.
