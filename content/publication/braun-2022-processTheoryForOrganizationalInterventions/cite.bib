 abstract = {Organizations are complex, multilevel, dynamic systems comprised of many interacting processes. The goal of organizational interventions is to
generate an intentional positive influence on the way in which one or more organizational
processes unfold. In their focal article, Watts et al. (2021) correctly point
out that, through the act of intervening, unintended consequences may occur such that processes
and outcomes not directly targeted by the intervention may be altered. One solution, omitted by Watts et al. (2021), to better understand, predict, and detect consequences
of organizational interventions is to develop more process theories combined with
leveraging computational modeling. Through extending our current theories to include a more
precise description of relevant organizational processes, we believe that potential consequences,
intended and unintended, of interventions will become more apparent. Then, by instantiating
those process theories of interventions into computational models, predictions can be made
regarding when, where, why, and how interventions influence various processes.},
