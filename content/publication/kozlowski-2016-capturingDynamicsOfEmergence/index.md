abstract: Emergent phenomena—those that manifest bottom-up from the psychological
  characteristics, perceptions, and interactions among individuals—are a fundamental
  dynamic process in multilevel theory, but have been treated in a very limited way
  in the research literature. In particular, treatments are largely assumed (rather
  than observed directly), retrospective, and static. This paper describes a research
  paradigm designed to examine directly the dynamics of micro-meso—individual, dyad,
  and team—emergent phenomena. We identify, describe, and illustrate the sequence
  of theoretical, measurement, computational, data analytic, and systematic research
  activities that are necessary to operationalize and utilize the paradigm. We illustrate
  the paradigm development process using our research, focused on learning and team
  knowledge emergence, and highlight key design principles that can be applied to
  examine other emergent phenomena in teams. We conclude with a discussion of contributions,
  strengths and limitations, and generalization of the approach to other emergent
  phenomena in teams.
