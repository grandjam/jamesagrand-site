abstract: Sensitivity reviews of test content are commonly advocated techniques for
  reducing bias and enhancing fairness in employment and educational testing. However,
  few descriptions or empirical investigations of these techniques exist. The present
  paper presents a study documenting common sensitivity review practices and the extent
  to which expert reviewers agree in their judgments of item sensitivity. Results
  indicated that reviewers do not always receive training or adequate guidance and
  most frequently encounter subtle forms of insensitive item content. Further, only
  modest agreement in expert ratings of item sensitivity was found. Implications for
  improving sensitivity review practices are presented.
