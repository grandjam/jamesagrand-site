abstract: Many factors have been proposed as potential causes for the underrepresentation
  of women in leadership positions. The present research leverages computational modeling
  and simulation to examine the impacts of external hiring and developmental opportunities,
  which may have consequences at different junctures in women's leadership labyrinth.
  Two agent-based simulations examined 1) the emergence of gender stratification in
  gender-balanced organizations and 2) the impact of reducing bias in external hiring
  and developmental opportunities in gender-stratified organizations. Results revealed
  that gender differences in external hiring heightened women's sense of tokenism
  and their turnover rates and that bias in developmental opportunities increased
  women's turnover rates due to a lack of promotions - a “sticky floor” effect. Further,
  improving women's leadership representation in gender-stratified organizations may
  be a rocky road – positive impacts were preceded by elevated turnover for women.
  Implications for organizational interventions are discussed. All code and datasets
  are available at https://github.com/grandjam/SamuelsonEtAl_GenderStratModel.
