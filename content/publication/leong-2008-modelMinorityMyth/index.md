abstract: The Model Minority Myth encompasses a broad, largely positive stereotype
  that describes Asian Americans as a perseverant, intelligent, academically and socioeconomically
  successful people who have built a comfortable and desirable lifestyle in the United
  States despite their minority status. However, the widespread acceptance of this
  viewpoint has led to the perception of Asian Americans as robotic, emotionless workers
  and human beings, subsequently affecting their ability to gain cultural and societal
  acceptance and achieve upward economic and social mobility. This chapter specifically
  explores the impact of the Model Minority Myth in the workplace and its resulting
  implications for career development. The description begins with a general discussion
  of the nature of stereotype development and evaluation, helping to set the stage
  for a more specific explication of the Model Minority Myth and other relevant Asian
  American stereotypes. The final half of the work discusses the potential consequences
  of the Model Minority Myth on various processes of normal organizational functioning,
  including selection, organizational entry and socialization, personnel training,
  performance appraisal, and mentoring. The chapter closes with a brief discussion
  of future research questions for the field with the goal of continuing to shed new
  light on the phenomenon and possible ways in which the Model Minority Myth can be
  overcome in organizations.
