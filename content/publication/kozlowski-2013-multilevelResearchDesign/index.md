abstract: Multilevel theory and research have advanced organizational science but
  are limited because the research focus is incomplete. Most quantitative research
  examines top-down, contextual, cross-level relationships. Emergent phenomena that
  manifest from the bottom up from the psychological characteristics, processes, and
  interactions among individuals—although examined qualitatively—have been largely
  neglected in quantitative research. Emergence is theoretically assumed, examined
  indirectly, and treated as an inference regarding the construct validity of higher
  level measures. As a result, quantitative researchers are investigating only one
  fundamental process of multilevel theory and organizational systems. This article
  advances more direct, dynamic, and temporally sensitive quantitative research methods
  designed to unpack emergence as a process. We argue that direct quantitative approaches,
  largely represented by computational modeling or agent-based simulation, have much
  to offer with respect to illuminating the mechanisms of emergence as a dynamic process.
  We illustrate how indirect and direct approaches can be complementary and, appropriately
  integrated, have the potential to substantially advance theory and research. We
  conclude with a set of recommendations for advancing multilevel research on emergent
  phenomena in teams and organizations.
