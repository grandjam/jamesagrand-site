abstract: "**Objectives:** To determine the impact of a low-resource-demand, easily disseminated computer-based teamwork process training intervention on teamwork behaviors and
   patient care performance in code teams.<br /><br />
   **Design:** A randomized comparison trial of computer-based teamwork training versus placebo training was conducted from
   August 2010 through March 2011.<br /><br />
   **Setting:** This study was conducted at the simulation suite within the Kado Family Clinical Skills Center, Wayne State University School
   of Medicine.<br /><br />
   **Participants:** Participants (n = 231) were fourth-year medical students and first-, second-, and third-year emergency medicine residents at Wayne State
   University. Each participant was assigned to a team of four to six members (n<sub>teams</sub> = 45).<br /><br />
   **Interventions:** Teams were randomly assigned to receive either a 25-minute computer-based training module targeting appropriate resuscitation teamwork behaviors
   or a placebo training module.<br /><br />
   **Measurements:** Teamwork behaviors and patient care behaviors were video recorded during high-fidelity simulated patient resuscitations
   and coded by trained raters blinded to condition assignment and study hypotheses. Teamwork behavior items (e.g., \\'chest radiograph findings communicated to team\\'
   and \\'team member assists with intubation preparation\\') were standardized before combining to create overall teamwork scores. Similarly, patient care items
   (\\'chest radiograph correctly interpreted\\'; \\'time to start of compressions\\') were standardized before combining to create overall patient care scores. Subject
   matter expert reviews and pilot testing of scenario content, teamwork items, and patient care items provided evidence of content validity.<br /><br />
   **Main results:** When controlling for team members' medically relevant experience, teams in the training condition demonstrated better teamwork (F(1, 42) = 4.81, p < 0.05; η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>
   = 10%) and patient care (F(1, 42) = 4.66, p < 0.05; η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 10%) than did teams in the placebo condition.<br /><br />
   **Conclusions:** Computer-based team training positively impacts teamwork and patient care during simulated patient resuscitations. This low-resource team training intervention may help to address the dissemination and sustainability issues associated with larger, more costly team training programs."
