abstract: Simulation has had a major impact in the advancement of healthcare team
  training and assessment. To date, most simulation-based training and assessments
  focus on the teamwork behaviors that impact team performance, often ignoring critical
  cognitive, motivational, and affective team processes. Evidence from team science
  research demonstrates a strong relationship between team cognition and team performance
  and suggests a role for simulation in the development of this team-level construct.
  In this article, we synthesize research from the broader team science literature
  to provide foundational knowledge regarding team cognition and highlight best practices
  for using simulation to target team cognition.
