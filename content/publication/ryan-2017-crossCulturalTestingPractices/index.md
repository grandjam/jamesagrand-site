abstract: There has been much speculation regarding the influence of cultural norms
  on the acceptance and use of personnel selection testing. This study examined the
  cross‐level direct effects of four societal cultural variables (performance orientation,
  future orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and tightness–looseness) on selection
  practices of organisations in 23 countries. A total of 1,153 HR professionals responded
  to a survey regarding testing practices in hiring contexts. Overall, little evidence
  of a connection between cultural practices and selection practices emerged. Implications
  of these findings for personnel selection and cross‐cultural research as well as
  directions for future work in this area are described.
