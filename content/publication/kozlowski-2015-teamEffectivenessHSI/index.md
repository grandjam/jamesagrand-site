abstract: Understanding the “human” in human systems integration (HSI) necessitates
  an understanding of this interplay of the person, team, technology, and system.
  The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the key considerations for
  HSI relevant to teams, teamwork, and team effectiveness. Given space constraints,
  we focus on achieving breadth of coverage and identifying core concerns, with pointers
  to more in depth coverage of relevant topics that are beyond the scope of the chapter.
  The chapter is structured as follows. We first characterize work teams and identify
  core considerations for team effectiveness and, thus, HSI. Then, we highlight research
  findings on team effectiveness organized around the input-process-output heuristic
  and its more contemporary dynamic representations. Finally, we close with a consideration
  of critical theory development and research issues necessary for advancing HSI with
  respect to supporting and enhancing team effectiveness.
