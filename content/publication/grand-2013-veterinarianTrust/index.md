abstract: '**Objective:** To gain a better understanding of the role of interpersonal
  trust in veterinarian-client interactions during routine health-care visits, develop
  a measure of trust uniquely suited to the context of veterinary medicine, and interpret
  the actions, beliefs, and perceptions that capture client trust toward veterinarians.<br /><br />
  **Design:** Correlational study.<br /><br />
  **Sample:** 103 veterinary students and 19 standardized clients
  with pets from a college of veterinary medicine at a large public Midwestern university.<br /><br />
  **Procedures:** A measure of trust specific to veterinarian-client interactions was constructed
  on the basis of preexisting conceptualizations of the construct and administered
  to veterinary students and standardized clients following interactions in 2 medical
  scenarios in a high-fidelity simulated animal health clinic. Exploratory and confirmatory
  factor analytic techniques were used to validate the measure of trust, and hierarchic
  linear modeling was used to explore indicators of standardized client trust perceptions
  in one of the scenarios.<br /><br />
  **Results:** Factor analysis revealed that the measure captured
  2 perceptions indicative of trust in veterinary contexts: professionalism and technical
  candor. Students who had behaviors reflecting these factors as well as those who
  were perceived as more technically competent were seen as more trustworthy by standardized
  clients.<br /><br />
  **Conclusions and clinical relevance:** The development of trustworthy relationships
  between clients and veterinarians is important to the continued growth and success
  of the profession. By identifying characteristics of veterinarian trustworthiness
  and developing related measurement tools, proactive approaches to monitoring veterinarian-client
  relations can be implemented and incorporated into veterinary training and practice
  programs to identify areas for improvement.'
