abstract: A common belief is that improvements in a test's face validity have a positive
  impact on the performance and perceptions of test takers. However, the stereotype
  threat literature suggests adding job relevant context to tests could negatively
  impact the performance of women if that context is traditionally male stereotyped.
  To test this prediction, 345 participants (n = 236 female) completed either a face
  valid or generic version of a mathematical and mechanical ability test under conditions
  of explicit or no explicit stereotype threat. Contrary to stereotype threat theory
  predictions, face validity had either beneficial or nonsignificant effects on test
  performance and test perceptions and did not affect the psychometric properties
  of either test. Implications and recommendations for future research regarding the
  study of face validity and stereotype threat are discussed.
