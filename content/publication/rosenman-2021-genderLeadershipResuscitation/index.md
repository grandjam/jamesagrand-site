abstract: '**Objective:** Team leadership facilitates teamwork and is important to patient
  care. It is unknown whether provider gender-based differences in team leadership
  exist. The objective of this study was to assess and compare team leadership and
  patient care in trauma resuscitations led by male and female providers.<br /><br />
  **Methods:** We performed a secondary analysis of data from a larger randomized controlled trial
  using video recordings of emergency department trauma resuscitations at a Level
  1 trauma center from April 2016 to December 2017. Subjects included emergency medicine
  and surgery residents functioning as trauma team leaders. Eligible resuscitations
  included adult patients meeting institutional trauma activation criteria. Two video-recorded
  observations for each participant were coded for team leadership quality and patient
  care by 2 sets of raters. Raters were balanced with regard to gender and were blinded
  to study hypotheses. We used Bayesian regression to determine whether our data supported
  gender-based advantages in team leadership.<br /><br />
  **Results:** A total of 60 participants and 120 video recorded observations were included. The modal relationship between
  gender and team leadership (β = 0.94, 95% highest density interval [HDI], -.68,
  2.52) and gender and patient care (β=2.42, 95%HDI, -2.03, 6.78) revealed a weak positive
  effect for female leaders on both outcomes. Gender based advantages to team leadership
  and clinical care were not conclusively supported or refuted, with the exception
  of rejecting a strong male advantage to team leadership.<br /><br />
  **Conclusions:** We prospectively measured team leadership and clinical care during patient care. Our findings do
  not support differences in trauma resuscitation team leadership or clinical care
  based on the gender of the team leader.'
