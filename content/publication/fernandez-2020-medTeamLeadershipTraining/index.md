abstract: '**Objectives**: Trauma resuscitations are complex critical care events that
  present patient safety-related risk. Simulation-based leadership training is thought
  to improve trauma care; however, there is no robust evidence supporting the impact
  of leadership training on clinical performance. The objective of this study was
  to assess the clinical impact of simulation-based leadership training on team leadership
  and patient care during actual trauma resuscitations.<br /><br />
  **Design:** Randomized controlled trial.<br /><br />
  **Setting:** Harborview Medical Center (level 1 trauma center).<br /><br />
  **Subjects:** Seventy-nine second- and third-year residents were randomized and 360 resuscitations were analyzed.<br /><br />
  **Interventions:** Subjects were randomized to a 4-hour simulation-based leadership training (intervention)
  or standard orientation (control) condition.<br /><br />
  **Measurements and main results:** Participant-led actual trauma resuscitations were video recorded and coded for leadership behaviors
  and patient care. We used random coefficient modeling to account for the nesting
  effect of multiple observations within residents and to test for post-training group
  differences in leadership behaviors while controlling for pre-training behaviors,
  Injury Severity Score, postgraduate training year, and days since training occurred.
  Sixty participants completed the study. There was a significant difference in post-training
  leadership behaviors between the intervention and control conditions (b<sub>1</sub> = 4.06,
  t(55) = 6.11, p < 0.001; intervention M = 11.29, SE = 0.66, 95% CI, 9.99-12.59
  vs control M = 7.23, SE = 0.46, 95% CI, 6.33-8.13, *d* = 0.92). Although patient care
  was similar between conditions (*b* = 2.00, t(55) = 0.99, p = 0.325; predicted means
  intervention M = 62.38, SE = 2.01, 95% CI, 58.43-66.33 vs control M = 60.38, SE
  = 1.37, 95% CI, 57.69-63.07, *d* = 0.15), a test of the mediation effect between training
  and patient care suggests leadership behaviors mediate an effect of training on
  patient care with a significant indirect effect (*b* = 3.44, 95% CI, 1.43-5.80). Across
  all trauma resuscitations leadership was significantly related to patient care (b<sub>1</sub>
  = 0.61, SE = 0.15, t(273) = 3.64, p < 0.001).<br /><br />
  **Conclusions:** Leadership training resulted in the transfer of complex skills to the clinical environment and may have
  an indirect effect on patient care through better team leadership.'
