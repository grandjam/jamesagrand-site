abstract: The focus of this chapter concerns a critical question for psychology researchers interested in applying big data methodsâ€”what can Big
  Data and computational social science do to improve the likelihood that its research
  meets emerging criteria for robust and reliable psychological science? We begin
  by first describing what we believe are the characteristics of a robust Big Data
  science and some of the more significant challenges for meeting these demands. The
  remainder of the chapter then focuses on three issues related to scientific credibility
  that have been frequent topics of discussion in psychology (hypothesizing after
  results are known (HARKing), questionable research practices (QRPs), and replicability/reproducibility),
  describing their relevance to Big Data research, and offering recommendations for
  facilitating reliable and robust contributions of Big Data science to psychology.
