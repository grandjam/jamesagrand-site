abstract: '**Purpose:** Our objective was to generate, define, and evaluate behavioral
  dimensions of ethical performance at work that are common across United States occupations.<br /><br />
  **Design/Methodology/Approach:** This project involved three studies. Study 1 involved (a) qualitative review of
  published literature, professional codes of ethics, and critical incidents of (un)ethical
  performance and resulted in (b) behavioral dimensions and ethical performance rating
  scales. The second and third studies used a retranslation methodology to evaluate
  the ethical performance dimensions from Study 1. The behavioral dimensions were
  linked to the performance determinants (personal attributes) in Study 3.<br /><br />
  **Findings:** Study 1 resulted in draft dimension definitions and rating scales for 10 ethical
  performance dimensions. In Studies 2 and 3, retranslation data provided strong support
  for 10 behavioral dimensions of ethical performance at work. Results from Study
  3 shed light on possible relationships among the performance dimensions based on
  their underlying performance determinants.<br /><br />
  **Implications:** Communicating an organizationâ€™s ethical standards to employees is important because some ethical breakdowns can
  be attributed to simply failing to recognize an ethical matter (in: DeCremer, Managerial
  ethics: Managing the psychology of morality, Routledge, New York, 2011). Definitions
  of ethical behavior in the workplace provide a tool for researchers, employers,
  and employees to communicate about ethical situations and a foundation for folding
  ethics into employee training and performance management.<br /><br />
  **Originality/Value:** These studies provide a taxonomy of ethical performance at work that generalizes to a
  diverse array of occupations and industries, and dimensions and rating scales have
  value for performance management, training/curriculum development, job analysis,
  predictor development and/or validation, and additional research.'
