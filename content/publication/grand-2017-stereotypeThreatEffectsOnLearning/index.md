abstract: Stereotype threat describes a situation in which individuals are faced with
  the risk of upholding a negative stereotype about their subgroup based on their
  actions. Empirical work in this area has primarily examined the impact of negative
  stereotypes on performance for threatened individuals. However, this body of research
  seldom acknowledges that performance is a function of learning—which may also be
  impaired by pervasive group stereotypes. This study presents evidence from a 3-day
  self-guided training program demonstrating that stereotype threat impairs acquisition
  of cognitive learning outcomes for females facing a negative group stereotype. Using
  hierarchical Bayesian modeling, results revealed that stereotyped females demonstrated
  poorer declarative knowledge acquisition, spent less time reflecting on learning
  activities, and developed less efficiently organized knowledge structures compared
  with females in a control condition. Findings from a Bayesian mediation model also
  suggested that despite stereotyped individuals “working harder” to perform well,
  their underachievement was largely attributable to failures in learning to “work
  smarter.” Building upon these empirical results, a computational model and computer
  simulation is also presented to demonstrate the practical significance of stereotype-induced
  impairments to learning on the development of an organization’s human capital resources
  and capabilities. The simulation results show that even the presence of small effects
  of stereotype threat during learning/training have the potential to exert a significant
  negative impact on an organization’s performance potential. Implications for future
  research and practice examining stereotype threat during learning are discussed.
