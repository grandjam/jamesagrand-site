abstract: Team cognition has been identified as a critical component of team performance
  and decision-making. However, theory and research in this domain continues to remain
  largely static; articulation and examination of the dynamic processes through which
  collectively held knowledge emerges from the individual- to the team-level is lacking.
  To address this gap, we advance and systematically evaluate a process-oriented theory
  of team knowledge emergence. First, we summarize the core concepts and dynamic mechanisms
  that underlie team knowledge-building and represent our theory of team knowledge
  emergence (Step 1). We then translate this narrative theory into a formal computational
  model that provides an explicit specification of how these core concepts and mechanisms
  interact to produce emergent team knowledge (Step 2). The computational model is
  next instantiated into an agent-based simulation to explore how the key generative
  process mechanisms described in our theory contribute to improved knowledge emergence
  in teams (Step 3). Results from the simulations demonstrate that agent teams generate
  collectively shared knowledge more effectively when members are capable of processing
  information more efficiently and when teams follow communication strategies that
  promote equal rates of information sharing across members. Lastly, we conduct an
  empirical experiment with real teams participating in a collective knowledge-building
  task to verify that promoting these processes in human teams also leads to improved
  team knowledge emergence (Step 4). Discussion focuses on implications of the theory
  for examining team cognition processes and dynamics as well as directions for future
  research.
