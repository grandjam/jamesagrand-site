 abstract = {Ethical decision-making has long been recognized as critical for
Industrial-Organizational psychologists in the variety of roles they fill in
education, research, and practice. Decisions with ethical implications are
not always readily apparent and often require consideration of competing
concerns. The American Psychological Association (APA) Ethical Principles
of Psychologists and Code of Conduct are the principles and standards to
which all SIOP members are held accountable and serve to aid in
decision-making. To this end, the primary focus of this article is the
development and presentation of an integrative ethical decision-making
framework rooted in and inspired by empirical, philosophical, and
practical considerations of professional ethics in APA. The purpose of this
framework is to provide a generalizable model that can be used to
identify, evaluate, resolve, and engage in discourse about topics
involving ethical issues. To demonstrate the efficacy of this general
framework to contexts germane to I-O psychologists, we subsequently
present and apply this framework to five scenarios, each involving an
ethical situation relevant to academia, practice, or graduate education in
I-O psychology. We hope to stimulate the refinement of ethical decisionmaking,
illustrate its application in our profession, and advance
conversations about ethical practices.},
