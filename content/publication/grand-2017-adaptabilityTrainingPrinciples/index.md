abstract: 'The goal of this chapter is to provide a broad overview of the research literature on enhancing learner adaptability. Throughout, we offer basic principles which summarize our recommendations for applying these empirically-supported techniques and approaches to adaptability training efforts. We begin the chapter by defining adaptability and its foundational psychological processes, and outlining some basic considerations for adaptability training. Next, we briefly discuss the unique properties of synthetic learning environments (SLEs) and the manner by which they can be used to foster adaptive thinking. Specifically, we focus on three important components of training design and delivery shown to facilitate adaptability in learners. Lastly, we conclude the chapter by providing recommendations for further reading and topics related to adaptability training.'
