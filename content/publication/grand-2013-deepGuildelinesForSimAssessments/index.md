abstract: Background Whether for team training, research or evaluation, making effective
  use of simulation-based technologies requires robust, reliable and accurate assessment
  tools. Extant literature on simulation-based assessment practices has primarily
  focused on scenario and instructional design; however, relatively little direct
  guidance has been provided regarding the challenging decisions and fundamental principles
  related to assessment development and implementation.  Objective The objective of
  this manuscript is to introduce a generalisable assessment framework supplemented
  by specific guidance on how to construct and ensure valid and reliable simulation-based
  team assessment tools. The recommendations reflect best practices in assessment
  and are designed to empower healthcare educators, professionals and researchers
  with the knowledge to design and employ valid and reliable simulation-based team
  assessments.  Overview Information and actionable recommendations associated with
  creating assessments of team processes (non-technical ‘teamwork’ activities) and
  performance (demonstration of technical proficiency) are presented which provide
  direct guidance on how to Distinguish the underlying competencies one aims to assess,
  Elaborate the measures used to capture team member behaviours during simulation
  activities, Establish the content validity of these measures and Proceduralise the
  measurement tools in a way that is systematically aligned with the goals of the
  simulation activity while maintaining methodological rigour (DEEP).  Summary The
  DEEP framework targets fundamental principles and critical activities that are important
  for effective assessment, and should benefit healthcare educators, professionals
  and researchers seeking to design or enhance any simulation-based assessment effort.
