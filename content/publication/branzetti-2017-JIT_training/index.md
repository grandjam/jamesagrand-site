abstract: "**Background:** A subset of high-risk procedures present significant safety
   threats due to their (1) infrequent occurrence, (2) execution under time constraints
   and (3) immediate necessity for patient survival. A Just-in-Time (JIT) intervention
   could provide real-time bedside guidance to improve high-risk procedural performance
   and address procedural deficits associated with skill decay.<br /><br />
   **Objective:** To evaluate the impact of a novel JIT intervention on transvenous pacemaker (TVP) placement
   during a simulated patient event.<br /><br />
   **Methods:** This was a prospective, randomised controlled study to determine the effect of a JIT intervention on performance
   of TVP placement. Subjects included board-certified emergency medicine physicians
   from two hospitals. The JIT intervention consisted of a portable, bedside computer-based
   procedural adjunct. The primary outcome was performance during a simulated patient
   encounter requiring TVP placement, as assessed by trained raters using a technical
   skills checklist. Secondary outcomes included global performance ratings, time
   to TVP placement, number of critical omissions and System Usability Scale scores
   (intervention only).<br /><br />
   **Results:** Groups were similar at baseline across all outcomes.
   Compared with the control group, the intervention group demonstrated statistically
   significant improvement in the technical checklist score (11.45 vs 23.44, p < 0.001,
   Cohen's d effect size 4.64), the global rating scale (2.27 vs 4.54, p < 0.001,
   Cohen's d effect size 3.76), and a statistically significant reduction in critical
   omissions (2.23 vs 0.68, p < 0.001, Cohen's *d* effect size -1.86). The difference
   in time to procedural completion was not statistically significant between conditions
   (11.15 min vs 12.80 min, p = 0.12, Cohen's *d* effect size 0.65). System Usability
   Scale scores demonstrated excellent usability.<br /><br />
   **Conclusion:** A JIT intervention improved procedure perfromance, suggesting a role for JIT interventions in rarely
   performed procedures."
