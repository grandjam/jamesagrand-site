abstract: "The implicit philosophy for how research and practice in industrial and
   organizational (I-O) psychology has pursued inferences about our field's core
   phenomena has largely been based on a nomothetic, variable-based, and aggregate/“large-sample”
   ideal. As Tett, Hundley, and Christiansen (2017) expertly highlight, there are
   more insightful means for drawing inferences about the nature of such aggregate
   relationships based on meta-analytic techniques than the current practice in the
   organizational sciences. However, the motivating force behind our commentary has
   less to do with the issues raised by Tett et al. (2017) concerning the practice
   of using meta-analysis for purposes of validity generalization and more to do
   with the practice of using meta-analysis for purposes of scientific inference.
   Between-person philosophies in which the end-goal is to identify general conclusions
   that apply to the aggregate (cf. Hanges & Wang, 2012) have historically guided
   our scientific inferences and have supported the proliferation of meta-analytic
   techniques (including what Tett et al. describe as tertiary analyses based on
   such findings). These philosophies have led to a dearth of understanding at the
   within-person and social system levels—the levels at which most of our meaningful
   phenomena exist (e.g., Hamaker, 2012; Von Bertalanffy, 1950). Learning, performing,
   decision making, communicating, sense-making, feeling/expressing emotion: These
   are the concepts that drive the lived experiences of individuals both inside and
   outside of the workplace, and all are vulnerable to being misunderstood or misinterpreted
   by focusing only on aggregate evidence at the between-person level. Consequently,
   we wish to first supplement Tett et al.’s recommendations for drawing generalizability
   inferences in meta-analysis and suggest a “pre-emptive” question (i.e., Question
   0) to the list of four they advance in their focal article."
