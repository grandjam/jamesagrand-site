I'm a firm believer that one key to success is to surround yourself with successful people. I have been very fortunate to work alongside and learn from many talented and successful students and colleagues in my career. Doing fun, interesting, and impactful science is truly a team sport, and the people listed here are among the best teammates I could hope to ask for. 

If you're a student interested in working together, please check out the pages for [prospective PhD students](/get-involved/prospective-phd-students) and [undergraduate research assistants](/get-involved/undergraduate-ra) for more information. If you're a researcher or practitioner interested in teaming together, please feel free to [contact](/#contact) me directly.
